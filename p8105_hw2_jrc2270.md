## Problem 1

The below code creates a dataset combining several datasets from a
FiveThirtyEight article called “Science Isn’t Broken: It’s just a hell
of a lot harder than we give it credit for.” The result is a dataset
with 823 observations containing information about the number of
national politicians in the US from each party, the closing values of
the S&P stock index, and percent unemployment in the US for each month
between January 1947 and July 2015. There are complete data for January
1950 to June 2015 except that August to December 1974 has no president
data due to a mistake in the raw data. The variable `president`
indicates whether the president was democratic (“dem”) or republican
(“gop”) during that month, `close` indicates the closing price of the
S&P stock index on one day that month, and `unemploy` gives the percent
unemployment rate.

``` r
pols <- 
  read_csv("Data/pols-month.csv") %>%
  separate(mon, c("year", "month"), sep="-", extra = "drop") %>%
  mutate(month = month.name[as.numeric(month)], 
         president = case_when(prez_dem == 1 ~ "dem", 
                               prez_gop == 1 ~ "gop")) %>%
  select(-starts_with("prez"))

snp <-
  read_csv("Data/snp.csv") %>%
  separate(date, c("month", NA, "year"), sep="/") %>%
  mutate(year = paste(ifelse(year < 23, "20", "19"), year, sep = ""), 
         month = month.name[as.numeric(month)]) %>%
  select(year, month, close)

unemploy <-
  read_csv("Data/unemployment.csv") %>%
  pivot_longer(Jan:Dec, 
               names_to = "month", 
               values_to = "unemploy",
               values_drop_na = TRUE) %>%
  transmute(year = as.character(Year), 
            month = month.name[match(month, month.abb)], 
            unemploy)

five38 <-
  list(pols, snp, unemploy) %>%
  reduce(full_join, by = join_by(year, month))
```

Here are the rows of the resulting dataset corresponding to the year
1950:

## Problem 2

The below code code produces a combined dataset containing trash
collection data for “Mr. Trash Wheel”, “Professor Trash Wheel”, and
“Gwynnda, the Good Wheel of the West” since each of their construction
in 2015, 2017, and 2021 respectively up to June 2023. You can read more
about the trash wheel family [here](https://www.mrtrashwheel.com/). The
dataset contains 845 total observations, grouped by `wheel_name` and
ordered by `date`. The other variables indicate the weight and volume of
garbage collected each day, as well as the quantity of garbage items of
various types. The total weight of trash collected by Professor Trash
Wheel was 216 tons and the total number of cigarettes collected by
Gwynnda in July 2021 was 16,300.

``` r
mr_trash <-
  read_excel("Data/202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", 
             sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel", 
             skip = 2,
             col_names = c("dumpster", "month", "year", "date", "weight", 
                           "volume", "bottles_plastic", "polystyrene",

  filter(!is.na(dumpster)) %>%
  mutate(wheel_name = "Professor", homes_calc = weight * 500 / 30) %>%
  select(wheel_name, everything())

gwynnda <-
  read_excel("Data/202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", 
             sheet = "Gwynnda Trash Wheel", 
             skip = 2,
             col_names = c("dumpster", "month", "year", "date", "weight", 
                           "volume", "bottles_plastic", "polystyrene", 
                           "cigarettes", "bags", "wrappers", 
                           "homes")) %>%
  filter(!is.na(dumpster)) %>%
  mutate(wheel_name = "Gwynnda", homes_calc = weight * 500 / 30) %>%
  select(wheel_name, everything())

trash_wheel <- 
  bind_rows(mr_trash, prof_trash, gwynnda) %>%
  group_by(wheel_name)
```
